# Code Repository

# 👋 Hi, I'm Vano

This repository is a reflection of my journey — ideas, drafts, explorations, and late-night thoughts that turned into something more structured.
It’s not just code, but also pieces of how I learn, build, and improve as both a programmer and an entrepreneur.

## 🚀 About Me

* Curious by nature, I like to break down complex stuff into something simple.
* Into **business, tech, and creative problem-solving**.
* Exploring **AI, system information, and application development**, while shaping my entrepreneurial mindset.
* I keep my flow casual — no strict structure, just hungry to grow.

## 📚 This Repo Contains

* Notes and drafts from projects and convos that capture my process of improving.
* Experiments in coding, product building, and pitching ideas.
* Personal reflections on **what it means to grow — not just technically as a programmer, but also strategically as an entrepreneur**.
* A mix of business insights, finance thoughts, and digital product brainstorming.
* Progress logs that show I’m not chasing perfection, but consistency and growth.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools I Use

* **Languages**: C, Go, JavaScript, Python (still expanding).
* **Design**: Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, Canva.
* **Workflow**: very organic — I don’t force structure. I let the project breathe, experiment with ideas, then shape it into something usable. Git & GitHub are here to keep things in motion.

## 🎯 Current Focus

Right now, I’m not rushing to the bigger picture.
I believe in trusting the process — learning and improving step by step matters more than skipping ahead.

* Digging deeper into **programming and system information fundamentals**.
* Developing **business instincts and entrepreneurial thinking** alongside the technical grind.
* Exploring **finance and business ideas** while still honing my craft in coding and digital building.

Basically, this is about laying the foundation before scaling bigger.

### ⚡ Fun fact

I like mixing serious work with random sparks of humor — anime refs, NBA stats, or just casual wordplay. Keeps things alive.
